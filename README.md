## Background ##
Skin Cancer is one of the most common type of cancer around the globe.  It is stated that one in every five american will develop skin cancer till the age of 70. 
When there is an abnormality in the skin cells than a tumor is formed. When this tumor is prevalent only uptill the *epidermis* than its called **Benign Tumor** but when it penetrates and enters the lower layer called *dermis* than it is called **Malignant Tumor** which can spread to other body parts. The most dangerous type of skin cancer is called **Melanoma** which is estimated to kill nearly 9320 people in the USA.

## What is this project about? ##
This project explains how to classify skin cancer images into benign, intermediate or malignant so that if the cancer is detected early than its almost curable. *Note - You need not to rely on this algorithm as it might be wrong, so if it shows a positive result, kindly contact a nearby dermatologist for confirmation.

## Data Collection ##
To train the classifier, the images were taken from [ISIS Archive](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/onlyHeaderTop/gallery). By setting the diagnostic attribute to **benign**, the filtered images were downloaded. As the main dataset is humoungous, I chose to try this algortihm with just 500 images per class, you can choose to increase the dataset to further increase the accuracy.
